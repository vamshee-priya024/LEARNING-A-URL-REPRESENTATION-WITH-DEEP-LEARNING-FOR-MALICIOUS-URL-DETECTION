# LEARNING-A-URL-REPRESENTATION-WITH-DEEP-LEARNING-FOR-MALICIOUS-URL-DETECTION
Developed an end-to-end deep learning framework to learn a nonlinear URL embedding for Malicious URL Detection directly from the URL by applying Convolutional Neural Networks to both characters and words of the URL String to learn the URL embedding in a jointly optimised framework.
